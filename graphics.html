<h3>Why aren't there many graphics?</h3>
<p>Graphics are not entirely meaningful to this website since the emphasis is to not distract from the more prominent visual elements, i.e. Ray's art and the dynamic CSS animations.</p>
<h3>So what graphics are there?</h3>
<p>The one strong element on the site that has a lot of identity is the logo which is persistently placed in the center top of the site. Many users are already accustomed to using the logo as an effective "home" button for returning them to the unaltered state of the site 
[<a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/08/the-ux-case-against-the-home-button/">Source</a>]. This has been taken into consideration with the only graphic present on the website that is not an <a href="icons.html">icon</a>.</p>
<h3>Let's see that logo then</h3>
<p> While looking through Ray's old work I found the following old logo design:
<center><img src="Images/protologo.png" alt="Proto logo"></center>
<br>While certainly not a bad logo it does not lend well to the styling of the rest of the site and while it would be ok against a white background it would probably be preferred with a transparent background. I was able to do just that with Gimp.<br>
<br><center><img src="Images/logo.png" alt="Transparent Proto logo"></center>
With this improved file for my logo I then used color selection tools in Gimp to change the solid colors to better match the two main colors of the site's design, #FFCC99 and #FFA25A. I did however need to use two more colors that were sequentially deeper shades of #FFA25A as it was the darker tone. 
Using Adobe's Kuler wheel I selected #BF7943 and #7F512D as my tones. 
<br><center><img src="Images/logo2.png" alt="Working Logo"></center></p>
<h3>Is this the final logo?</h3>
The logo above may not ultimately be the one that is deployed at final release. This is effectively a placeholder logo that succeeds in very directly expressing what the brand is. The logo is in a minimalist styling that along with its new color scheme matches both tonally and thematically with the rest of the site. There may very likely come an animated version of a logo that is not similar to what is shown above after further consultation with Ray.

<h3>Any developments?</h3>
<p>After some work I redesigned the logo to more strongly match with the website and just
overall look cleaner and less grainy. Following is the design process the new and final
logo went through. This time around I started entirely from scratch keeping in mind
the four tones I had selected from my previous design. I wanted to emphasize the idea
of black being the base color and that selection created an orange highlight.
This ultimately could not create many satisfactory logos and seemed more distracting
than anything else. In the end I chose to make a faux gradient over the text that would
imply either motion or dimension. In the context of the page, it is meant to signal
moving elements but also is very pleasing to the eye as it looks like a sunset.</p>

<h3>What's up with some of the pictures?</h3>
<p>
	The inquisitive viewer may have noticed that a lot of the art on the site
	is rather compressed and isn't really indicative of the kind of releases
	that a digital artist can output. The reason for this is that the hosting server
	for this site would probably not appreciate being inundated with 100MB of
	high resolution pictures, the actual high resolutions will be included in
	the final release of the site which will be hosted on a server that does
	not have these limitations. Another thing you may have noted is that
	when you open the lightbox of some of the sprites the image can seem rather small
	in a large browser window. This is due to the lighboxes being instructed to not
	blow out the images and to display the true resolution of the image, which for
	a sprite can be rather small.
