<br><h3>What was the goal with these icons?</h3>
<p>An art portfolio is a medium where the art should ideally be the only 
focus for the viewer and not a lot of extra visuals. These icons 
needed to take the place of a lot of other graphics and instill
some basic ideas at a quick glance. The icons are also a vital 
part to the establishing of theme in a website design. 
In this case the theme was uniform sized, monochromotaic, simple, and 
essential forms of the evoked idea. Other themes are the inclusion
of the whitespace as lining, soft lines, and primarily positive 
space as form. The icons were chosen specifically for their
closeness to westerner's proto-object understandings of the 
concepts of <i>home</i>, <i>mail</i>, <i>art</i>, <i>pencil</i>, and <i>games</i>.
Given the context these can be read as <i>home base</i>, <i>contact</i>,
<i>full art</i>, <i>line art</i>, and <i>game art</i>.
The icons themselves on the page are vectorized SVG files that should
not suffer from degredation at any size and should render/scale quickly. </p> 

<h3>Anything special about some of these icons?</h3>
The home, mail, and line art icons are fairly straight forward
to implement and make understandable to users.
The full art, and pixel art icons are 
far more interesting choices that creatively develop 
their ideas. 
The full art icon is an artist's palette which evokes
both the ideas of art but more centrally the idea of color
since the pallete is used to select and blend colors.
This gives off the impression of full painted art, while
the art itself is created digitally it sets some expectation
of seeing a depth of color.
The game art icon is a classic game controller used on the 
Super Nintendo console from 1990. Most gamers will be able to identify 
this as a controller if not the exact model. However, the most
important features it had are the typical direction pad,
action button, ergonomic shape, and cable. These elements
all have persisted into modern console controllers that even 
young gamers can still recognize.
