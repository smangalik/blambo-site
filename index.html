<h3>Who is this Website For?</h3>
<p>The site is a commissioned work for Stony Brook student and artist, <strong>Ray Chen</strong>. It is worked on by Siddharth Mangalik (Sid).</p>

<h3>What the Website's Purpose?</h3>
<p>To <strong>display art</strong> that has been created by Ray Chen in a way that better conveys the themes and attitudes that are attached with his art than a template could accomplish. Another specific concern that this page addresses is the need for clean and simple design that is uncluttered by advertisements, branding, and other non-removable elements. The previous iteration of the site, done with a template, was <a href = "http://raychenart.com">http://raychenart.com</a> </p>

<h3>Where is the Scope of the Website?</h3>
<p>Ray is making an advanced profile for his programming, art, and personal resume and qualifications. The objective with this class project is to make <strong>the art portfolio for Ray’s profile</strong>. The entire ecosystem seeks to be consistent in only relative placements, taking large differences in aesthetic choice otherwise. While this project only ventures into the art portfolio it may later expand to encompass the other parts of Ray’s profile. </p>

<h3>What is Unique about the Website’s Design?</h3>
<p>The design is specifically made to attract the attention of the viewer and entice them to explore the intuitive flow of control it presents. A <strong>strong sense of minimalism</strong> was employed that includes a low density of elements, use of implicit narrative, and a simplified color palette of white, black, and orange pastels. The generally flat perspective of the website also lends to a sense of ease. Ultimately these elements and themes will integrate themselves into Ray’s personal aesthetic Blambo. </p>

<h3>How is it being made? </h3>
<p>The major technologies involved on this page are <strong>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and JQuery</strong>, not including the many content creation softwares that were involved in the creation of the various graphics, icons, and schematics present. </p>

<h3>Who is the User of this Website?</h3>
<p>Users of this website are both young adults who are interested in Ray’s more contemporary art style as well as professionals who wish to view Ray’s portfolio. The casual users will be looking for a fun viewing experience that will give them streamlined process for viewing all of the art with a low level of cognitive overhead. For professional viewers there will still be a more formal and conventional form submitting system that does not however throwaway the base aesthetic</p>
