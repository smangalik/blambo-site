<br><h3>What Dynamic Media does the site have?</h3>
<p>As mentioned many times in the documentation, the emphasis
on not including a lot of detailed art that was part of the
site still needs to be retained. This meant that the only big
candidates for dynamic behavior were the logo and the site
icons. I ultimately decided against making either animated since
it could very quickly be distracting with the three tandem
slideshows that the website currently employs. The main 
dynamic nature of the site is in the CSS animations that it
employs and the kind of scenes and story they tell.</p>

<h3>What is the narrative?</h3>
<p>
When the site first opens you are introduced to three panels 
that slide into position over a black box frame. The box frame 
is a persistent structure whose dimensions are always ultimately
upkeep despite whatever transitions occur. Next comes the user having
to interact with the site. The user seeing the three panels will likely
try to interact with them and when hovering over them will see a fade 
out to a panel of a different color. If the user finds themselves on the
main screen for too long slideshows will begin that replace the panel 
elements. In the selected active view the user sees their selection persist
while the other two options come in to view from an overflow. This repetition
of icons indicates that they will lead to the same menu that the other panels
would have done. In the mobile view a similar approach is taken with simpler 
animation choices that aim to distract less with what little screen real estate
is available.

<h3>Lightbox examples?</h3>
